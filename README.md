# 🛠️ Simple Service Booking System (API-Based) – Laravel 12

This is a basic service booking system built with Laravel 12 that allows **customers** to register, log in, view services, and book them. An **admin** user can manage services and view all bookings.

This project was developed for a coding task by **Qtec Solution Limited** to demonstrate API development, authentication, database relationships, validation, and clean code organization.
